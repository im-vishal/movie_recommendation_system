# movie_recommendation_system

I've created this movie_recommendation_system app on Heroku which recommends 5 most related movies on basis of genre, casts & theme of the selected movie.

**Libraries used:**
- pandas
- streamlit
- nltk

This system is created with bag_of_words algorithm in Natural Language Processing.

I've used stemming method to get the root words.

If you've any questions related to Heroku deployment, you can check the Heroku documentation page.
